# BookLibrary-JAXRS-SchoolProject
JAX-RS with a Java console application to query, add , update and delete books. In collaboration with Grace (Saeri) Lee, and Frederic Paquette

## Get Started
To get this application to work, just save the zip file to your computer, download Netbeans with Apache or use any Java IDE with Apache support.

Remember to change the tomcat-users.xml file in the /conf folder of installed Apache to use your chosen username and password. Then open it in your IDE of choice and run both the Library backen, and the console application to query it.
